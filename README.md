**HR Analytics Power BI Dashboard**
=============================

**Overview**
----------

This project aims to create a comprehensive HR Analytics dashboard in Power BI, focusing on analyzing and visualizing various key performance indicators (KPIs) related to employee attrition, retention, and other critical HR metrics. The dashboard provides an interactive platform for HR professionals to explore and analyze the data, identify trends, and make informed decisions.

**Objectives**
------------

1. To design and develop a user-friendly Power BI dashboard that provides insights into employee attrition rates, retention rates, and other relevant HR metrics.
2. To perform data cleaning and transformation to ensure data quality and integrity.
3. To create interactive visualizations and dashboards that enable users to explore the data in detail.

**Data Sources**
--------------

1. **Employee Data**: The primary data source for this project is a CSV file containing employee information, including demographics, job roles, tenure, and separation reasons.
2. **HR System Data**: Additional data was extracted from the HR system, including employee performance ratings, training records, and promotion history.

**Data Cleaning and Transformation**
--------------------------------

1. **Data Cleaning**: The following steps were taken to clean the data:
	* Removed duplicates and handled missing values
	* Standardized data formats and converted date columns to datetime format
	* Removed irrelevant columns and data
2. **Data Transformation**: The following transformations were performed:
	* Calculated employee tenure in months
	* Created categories for job roles, departments, and manager levels
	* Converted categorical variables to numerical values

**Dashboard Features**
-------------------

1. **Attrition Rate**: A interactive gauge chart showing the overall attrition rate over time.
2. **Employee Turnover**: A bar chart comparing employee turnover rates by job role, department, and manager level.
3. **Reasons for Leaving**: A pie chart illustrating the top reasons for employee separation.
4. **Employee Retention**: A line chart showing employee retention rates over time.
5. **Training and Development**: A bubble chart showing the correlation between employee training hours and retention rates.
6. **Promotion History**: A table showing the promotion history of employees, including the number of promotions received.

**Technical Details**
-------------------

1. **Power BI Version**: This project uses Power BI Desktop version 2022.
2. **Data Modeling**: The data model used in this project is a star schema with fact tables for employee information and dimension tables for job roles, departments, and manager levels.
3. **Visualizations**: The dashboard includes a variety of visualizations, including gauges, bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and bubble charts.

**Future Development**
--------------------

1. **Additional Data Sources**: Integrate additional data sources, such as performance evaluation data or customer satisfaction surveys.
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement machine learning algorithms to predict employee attrition risk or identify high-potential employees.
3. **Customizable Dashboards**: Allow users to create custom dashboards based on their specific needs and interests.
